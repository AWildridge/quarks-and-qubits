A measurement of the extent of entanglement in top quark-antiquark ($\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$) events produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is performed with the data recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016. An entanglement-sensitive observable $D$ is derived from the top quark spin-dependent parts of the $\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$ production density matrix and measured in the region of the $\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$ production threshold. Values of $D < -1/3$ are evidence of entanglement and $D$ is observed (expected) to be $-0.480^{+0.026}_{-0.029}$ ($-0.467^{+0.026}_{-0.029}$) at the parton level. With an observed significance of 5.1 standard deviations with respect to the non-entangled hypothesis, this provides observation of quantum mechanical entanglement within top quark pairs in this phase space. This measurement provides a new probe of quantum mechanics at the highest energies ever produced.
