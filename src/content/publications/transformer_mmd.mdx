In this note, a multilayer perceptron and a transformer model are trained on Monte Carlo simulations of the $t\bar t$ dileptonic decay channel to estimate the four-momenta of both top quarks in each event. The transformer achieves an average of 30% improvement in resolution of top quark and $t\bar t$ kinematic variables compared to the commonly used existing analytical method, and also outperforms the multilayer perceptron model by about 7%. It is also able to reconstruct approximately 5% of events that the analytic method cannot reconstruct.
