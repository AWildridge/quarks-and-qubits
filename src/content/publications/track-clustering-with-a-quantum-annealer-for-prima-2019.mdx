Clustering of charged particle tracks along the beam axis is the first step in reconstructing the positions of hadronic interactions, also known as primary vertices, at hadron collider experiments. We use a 2036 physical qubit D-Wave quantum annealer to perform track clustering in a limited capacity on artificial events where the positions of primary vertices and tracks resemble those measured by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. We note the quantum algorithm outperforms simulated annealing, constrained to the same processor time per anneal, up to a 56 logical qubit problem that involves 665 physical qubits on average.
